							<p>My research interests are in the broad area of theoretical Cosmology from the cosmic microwave background to the early universe.
								In particular, I am interested in cosmological applications of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids.

	<!--					<h2 id="content">The early universe cosmology</h2>
						<p>There is a widely accepted early universe paradigm called Inflation in which accelerated cosmic
							expansion solves the initial condition problem of the hot Big Bang universe. What kind of fields
							drive inflation? How are the fields related to our standard model of particle physics?
							The next stage of cosmology is to identify such details of the scenario.
							We usually constrain early universe models by observing the classical fluctuations on the present sky
							(i.e. large scale structure e.g. galaxies and halos, temperature anisotropies in the CMB etc...)
							since these originally arise from quantum fluctuations of fields during inflation. Successful
							observational experiments have revealed that such primordial fluctuations are almost adiabatic,
							Gaussian and scale invariant.<BR>

						While it is surprising that, on the present sky, there exist imprints of the very beginning of
						the universe whose energy scale may be beyond 10<sup>15</sup>GeV, further investigations are
						becoming difficult because the cosmological photon fluids have shear viscosity on the small scales,
						so that the short wavelength temperature perturbations are erased and cannot be observed.
						We should keep in mind that the visible scales from the latest anisotropy experiments are no
						greater than 10% of the total inflationary scales in a logarithmic unit.
						Therefore, we need new strategies to verify the inflationary model in more details because
						there may exist signals of non-standard physics on the ``smaller scales''. I would like to find
						a solution to these issues of inflationary models and understand the early universe more and more.
						For this purpose, I am working on researches.
